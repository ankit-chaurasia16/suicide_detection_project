## 📈 Dataset Information

Due to GitHub's file size limitations, the dataset (Suicide_Detection.csv) needs to be downloaded separately:

1. **Option 1**: Download from [Kaggle Suicide Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikhileswarkomati/suicide-watch)
2. **Option 2**: The model will work with a backup algorithm if dataset is not found
3. **Option 3**: Use Git LFS for large file handling

## 🚀 Deployment

Ready for deployment on:
- Render
- Heroku  
- Railway
- Local development
